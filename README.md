This Repo contains one R script file (run_analysis.R) which relies on all relevant text files being in the working directory. These files are:

activity_labels.txt
features.txt
subject_test.txt
subject_train.txt
X_test.txt
X_train.txt
y_test.txt
y_train.txt

Additionally, there is a Markdown file (CodeBook.md) which contains an explanation of the code contained in the R script file.

Happy Cleaning
